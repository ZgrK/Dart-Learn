## What is Dart Programming Language ?

Dart is a general-purpose programming language developed by Google. It is an object-oriented language that is suitable for building large-scale applications, and it can be used to build web, mobile, and desktop applications.

One of the main features of Dart is its support for "hot reloading," which allows developers to make changes to their code and see the results immediately, without the need to stop and start the application. This makes it easy to try out new ideas and iterate quickly on designs.

Dart is also designed to be easy to learn and use. It has a familiar syntax, with many elements that will be familiar to developers who have worked with other popular programming languages. In addition, the Dart ecosystem includes a large set of libraries and tools that make it easy to build high-quality applications.


## What is Dart Dev ?

The site also includes a section for developers, with resources for building and deploying applications with Dart.
